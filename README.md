## Development

-   Clone this repo.
-   Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and toggle Developer mode in the top right corner. Click the `Load unpacked` button that appears in the top left corner.
-   Navigate to the where the cloned directory is in your filesystem and select it.
-   When you make a change to the code, reload the extension from this page by clicking the round reload arrow.

### Debugging

As the extension doesn't use a HTML file it's a bit trickier to debug than an extension that does: you're not able to simply right-click on the extension icon and click `Inspect`. Instead, click on the `Details` button from the `chrome://extensions` page and find the `Inspect Views` option. Click `background page (inactive)` and a Dev Tools window will appear ready for debugging.
